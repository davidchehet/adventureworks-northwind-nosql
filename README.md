AdventureWorks Schema : [AdvWorksOLTPSchema2005.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18894259/AdvWorksOLTPSchema2005.pdf)

In this project, I displayed profiency in taking two structured databases, and merging them into a NoSQL database with MongoDB.
In order to make my NoSQL able to be query-able, it required several steps.
  1) Evaluating the two schemas to see which fields/columns are identical. For example, the 'suppliers' in Northwind is the same as the 'Vendor'. This had to be done for the entirety of my NoSQL database.
